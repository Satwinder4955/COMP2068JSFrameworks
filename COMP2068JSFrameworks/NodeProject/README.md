Introduction: The Application is a web-based platform designed to facilitate file and folder management with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This README provides an overview of the application's structure and functionality.

Importing Required Modules:
The require function is used to import necessary modules from Node.js and third-party packages.
Modules such as http-errors, express, path, hbs, passport, mongoose, and custom modules like express-session, User, authorization are imported.

Setting Up the Express Application:
An instance of the Express application is created using express().
Configuration for views engine (Handlebars - hbs) is set using app.set("views", ...) and app.set("view engine", ...).
Handlebars partials are registered using hbs.registerPartials(...).
Middleware like logger, json, urlencoded and static file serving middleware are added to the Express application using app.use().

Session Configuration:
The express-session middleware is used for session handling. It is configured with a secret key and options like resave and saveUninitialized.

Passport Configuration:
Passport.js, an authentication middleware for Node.js, is configured with Express.
Strategies for user authentication are defined using User.createStrategy().
Serialization and deserialization functions are set up using passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser().

Routing:
Route handlers for different paths are registered using app.use() with appropriate routers (indexRouter and productsRouter).
The routes are mounted at the root path ("/") and the "/products" path.

Connecting to the Database:
Mongoose is used to establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
The connection string is obtained from the dbConfig module imported from ./configs/database.

Error Handling:
Middleware for handling 404 errors and general error handling is set up.
When an error occurs, the error handler middleware renders an error page (error.hbs) and sends an appropriate HTTP status code.

Conclusion
In summary, the provided application sets up an Express.js web server, configures middleware for various functionalities, establishes a connection to a MongoDB database, and defines routes for handling different types of requests. It also includes error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and proper response to errors.
